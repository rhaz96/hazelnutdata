### What's the Problem?

For quite awhile I was wondering about a potential disconnect in the way the Central Limit Theorem (a.k.a CLT) is taught and how it's applied.  Usually in statistics textbooks and online tutorials the reasoning goes like this:

* Collect a set of observations (say, 20) and calculate the mean of that one sample of data
* Collect another set of 20 observations and calculate the mean of that second sample of data
* Repeat this process many, many times (say 10,000 times)
* You now have 10,000 sample means.  Plot a histogram of those sample means.  (This is known as a *distribution of sample means*)
* Shazam!  That distribution you plotted looks something like a normal distribution!  That's the CLT!

If you were to increase the set of observations collected each time from 20 to, say 25, then the resulting histogram would look even closer to a normal distribution.  

This gives the impression it's through *repeatedly* gathering sets of 20 (or 25 or more) observations we can say the distribution of the sample means is approximately normal.  Boston University's School of Public Health makes [similar remarks](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Probability/BS704_Probability12.html):

> *The central limit theorem states that if you...take sufficiently large random samples from the population...then the 
> distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed*

But what happens when you're given only *one* sample of data? How come we can invoke the CLT here?  An example Boston University provides does just that, remarking 

> *probability questions about a __sample mean__ can be addressed with the 
> Central Limit Theorem, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large*

I bolded "sample mean" because we shifted from talking about distribution of sample *means* (plural) to just a sample *mean* (singular)

This has proved confusing for a number of people, myself included, as is evidenced in [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/223214/why-are-all-clt-problems-using-a-single-random-sample-when-the-clt-requires-rep?noredirect=1&lq=1) and [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/211499/why-does-the-central-limit-theorem-work-with-a-single-sample?noredirect=1&lq=1) post from CrossValidated.

### What the CLT really says

Suppose you want to find amount how many M&Ms are in a standard share size bag.  ![](/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/Screenshot at Mar 24 18-06-52.png)
