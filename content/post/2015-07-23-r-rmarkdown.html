<h3>What’s the Problem?</h3>
<p>For quite awhile I was wondering about a potential disconnect in the way the Central Limit Theorem (a.k.a CLT) is taught and how it’s applied. Usually in statistics textbooks and online tutorials the reasoning goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect a set of observations (say, 20) and calculate the mean of that one sample of data</li>
<li>Collect another set of 20 observations and calculate the mean of that second sample of data</li>
<li>Repeat this process many, many times (say 10,000 times)</li>
<li>You now have 10,000 sample means. Plot a histogram of those sample means. (This is known as a <em>distribution of sample means</em>)</li>
<li>Shazam! That distribution you plotted looks something like a normal distribution! That’s the CLT!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to increase the set of observations collected each time from 20 to, say 25, then the resulting histogram would look even closer to a normal distribution.</p>
<p>This gives the impression it’s through <em>repeatedly</em> gathering sets of 20 (or 25 or more) observations we can say the distribution of the sample means is approximately normal. Boston University’s School of Public Health makes <a href="http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Probability/BS704_Probability12.html">similar remarks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The central limit theorem states that if you…take sufficiently large random samples from the population…then the
distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what happens when you’re given only <em>one</em> sample of data? How come we can invoke the CLT here? An example Boston University provides does just that, remarking</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>probability questions about a <strong>sample mean</strong> can be addressed with the
Central Limit Theorem, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bolded “sample mean” because we shifted from talking about distribution of sample <em>means</em> (plural) to just a sample <em>mean</em> (singular)</p>
<p>This has proved confusing for a number of people, myself included, as is evidenced in <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/223214/why-are-all-clt-problems-using-a-single-random-sample-when-the-clt-requires-rep?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1">this</a> and <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/211499/why-does-the-central-limit-theorem-work-with-a-single-sample?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1">this</a> post from CrossValidated.</p>

<h3>What the CLT really says</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to find amount how many M&amp;Ms are in a standard share size bag. <img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/Screenshot%20at%20Mar%2024%2018-06-52.png" /></p>
