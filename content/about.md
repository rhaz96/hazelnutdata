title: About

Hello and welcome to my blog!  My inspiration for this comes from my work as a teaching assistant to a graduate-level applied statistics course at [SMU](https://datascience.smu.edu/), where I'm currently completing my Masters degree in data science.

If you wondering where the name Hazelnut Data comes from, it's because my name is Robert Hazell...and I like hazelnuts too.

This blog is designed to capture my statistics and data science musings that I hope illuminates concepts in those fields.  

In my spare time I love reading philosophy, biking throughout New York City, and long walks.  

I hope you find this blog useful.  It's still very much under construction!  All feedback is welcome.  Contact me via [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/robertmhazell) or by email: rmhazell@outlook.com
