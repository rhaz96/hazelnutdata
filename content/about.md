Hello and welcome to my blog!  I'm Robert Hazell.  My inspiration for this comes from my work I began in January 2020 as a teaching assistant to a graduate-level applied statistics course at [SMU](https://datascience.smu.edu/), where I completed my M.S. in Data Science in August 2020.  I received my undergrad degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

I started this blog in March 2020 to capture and solidify my statistics and data science musings that I hope illuminates concepts in those fields for both you and me.

I hope you find this blog useful!  All feedback is welcome.  Contact me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/robertmhazell/) or by email: rmhazell@outlook.com
