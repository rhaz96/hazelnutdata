Hello and welcome to my blog!  I'm Robert Hazell.  My inspiration for this comes from my work I began in January 2020 as a teaching assistant to a graduate-level applied statistics course at [SMU](https://datascience.smu.edu/), where I'm currently completing my Masters degree in data science (expected graduation: August 2020).  I received my undergrad degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

I started this blog in March 2020 to capture and solidify my statistics and data science musings that I hope illuminates concepts in those fields for both you and me.

In my spare time I love reading philosophy, biking throughout New York City, and long walks.  

I hope you find this blog useful!  All feedback is welcome.  Contact me via [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/robertmhazell) or by email: rmhazell@outlook.com
