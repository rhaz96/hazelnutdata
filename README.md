# Statistical Musings

Files related to my website [http://statisticalmusings.netlify.com](statisticalmusings.netlify.com) where I try to fill some gaps relating to statistics and modeling that I feel are sometimes ignored in textbooks or on the web (I only look at the first 3 pages in Google search results!).  

Projects and recreational coding pieces I've done also reside on my website.
