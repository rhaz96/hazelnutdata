El-Assi, et al 2017 perform a similar types of analysis of Toronto’s bike share program, developing models for weekday, weekend, station origin, and station destination ridership. Adjusted \({R^2}\) values hover around 0.66.
Wang et al 2012 use 19 total socioeconomic variables to develop a regression model for station level, 2011 ridership of the Nice Ride bike share program in Minneapolis. Notably no weather variables are included.</description>
