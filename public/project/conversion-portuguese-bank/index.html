<h1>Part I - Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
<div id="business-understanding" class="section level2">
<h2>Business Understanding</h2>
<p>The Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was selected to be analyzed by our group. The data involves information obtained from direct telemarketing campaigns from a Portuguese banking institution. The data contains 41,188 observations with 20 attributes and was collected between May 2008 to November 2010.</p>
<p>Our objective is to build a customer conversion model that predicts the likelihood a customer converts after seeing a bank term deposit offer. A cash investment, which will be held at the bank, is invested at an agreed rate of interest over a fixed period of time. Characteristics of a customer such as age, education, type of job, and many others will be analyzed to determine if they are factors determining conversion.</p>
<p>A good prediction algorithm would establish a relationship or correlation between specific attributes with the probability of whether a bank customer would subscribe to a bank term deposit. We will assess the qualities of our models using a confusion matrix. With the results from our analysis, the attributes that are strongly correlated to a customer subscribing to a bank term deposit would be emphasized in future telemarketing campaigns.</p>

<div id="verifying-data-quality" class="section level3">
<h3>Verifying Data Quality</h3>
<p>The quality of the data initially appears relatively good as there are no missing or NA values. However, further reading into the documentation reveals several missing attribute values, all for categorical variables. These are encoded as “unknown”. We’ll need to decide on either treating these “unknown” values as a possible class label, delete or impute these values. The attributes that contain the “unknown” value are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>job</code> (330 instances)</li>
<li><code>marital</code> (80 instances)</li>
<li><code>education</code> (1731 instances)</li>
<li><code>default</code> (8597 instances)</li>
<li><code>housing</code> (990 instances)</li>
<li><code>loan</code> (990 instances)</li>
</ul>
<p>For now in our exploratory data analysis we’ll keep ‘unknown’ values as a class label, but will need to re-evaluate this value in future analysis.</p>
<p>There are 12 duplicate observations, which accounts for about 0.1% of the data. However, without an attribute to indicate if each observation is unique like ‘CustomerId’, it is very possible that the duplicate observations are legitmate observations that are unrelated to the other duplicates.</p>
<p>There are outliers in several attributes. For <code>age</code> the majority of the customers fall between the ages of 17 and 60, with 10 customers over the age of 90. The <code>campaign</code> attribute, which measures how often a customer is contacted, also has some extreme values where 8 customers were contacted over 40 times during a marketing campaign. Visualization of these and other features are presented a little later. Future analysis will need to be done with and without outliers to determine any possible improvement in model adequacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="simple-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Simple Statistics</h3>
<p>The table below displays the simple statistics for the numeric values of the data set.</p>
<p>We see the average bank customer is around 40 years old and contacted 2 to 3 times during the marketing campaign, but rarely contacted before the marketing campaign as deduced from the means of <code>pdays</code> and <code>previous</code> attributes, which measure the number of days after the customer was last contacted from a previous campaign and the number of times the customer was contacted before the current campaign respectively. As one would expect, the targeted customers are at an age where investing makes sense. Customers in the lower age range (late teens to early 30’s) are less likely to invest their money as they may not be planning for the future or may not have the disposable income to invest.</p>

<p>There is some right skew in terms of the age range the bank targets, with the majority of customers targeted in their 30s-40s. This makes sense as those in that age bracket would more likely have money to spend on long-term deposits given a stable income.

<p>We see evidence of bimodality and right-skew from this violinplot, aspects not clearly seen in the inscribed boxplot.</p>
<p>Bankers followed up with them roughly between 3 and 6 days after their latest call for most people in this data. The two peaks are perhaps indicative of early stage sale-pitching by the banks where communication is frequent.

As you’d expect the bank tends to target those who have, at the very least, completed high school. Greatest preference is shown towards college educated individuals. Again, this makes sense since they tend to earn more money relative to other education groups, making them likelier to deposit money.</p>

<p>We can visualize a cross tabulation between education level and job status. There isn’t much to be said for <code>illiterate</code> folks, but for those with <code>unknown</code> education tend to work blue-collar, admin, and technician type jobs. The most blue collar employees are those with <code>basic.4y</code>, <code>basic.6y</code>, and <code>basic.9y</code> educations. It’s not clear what these categories represent. College educated individuals work predominantly as admins, in management, or as technicians. High school grads also work in large proportion within admin, but also in the services industry.</p>

<p>Almost no correlation is present between consumer confidence and the price index. That being said, the price index is relatively consistent in this data, ranging from ~ 92 to ~ 95, so it’s unsurprising to see a flat relationship between these variables (the correlation is ~ 0.06). Consumer confidence was negative in Portugal throughout 2014 (when this data was taken) and has been that way for nearly the past decade, as can be seen <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/portugal/consumer-confidence">here</a>. As an aside, that the correlation between price index and consumer confidence is slightly <em>positive</em> is mildly interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing">As is pointed out</a> call duration isn’t known before the bank makes a call, and the outcome of the call is known immediately after a call. So <code>duration</code> can’t be used as a predictor when building a model. Nevertheless, for those who’ve been contacted before, bank-rejecters spend on average less time engaging with the bank agent. The distribution of talk time is right-skewed regardless of call outcome. When analyzing the response and <code>duration</code> it needs to be done in a retrospective manner.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, <code>student</code>s have the highest prevalence (~31.4%) albeit being one of the least targeted demographics. By contrast <code>blue-collar</code> prospects were second most called (see “Education Levels” section) yet had the lowest conversion rate at ~ 6.9%.

<p>With only 18 <code>illiterate</code> contacts it’s no surprise seeing an inflated prevalence rate for that group. Just like job category, we see an asymmetry in education level: those with an unknown education fall nearly last in terms of being contacted (see “Education level of prospects” section) but converted second most often (or the most often if you ignore contacts who were illiterate).</p>

<h3>Extra features</h3>
<p>Here are some other variables that could widen the scope of analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Monthly) Income: this adds more info than <code>loan</code> or <code>default</code></li>
<li>Current bank provider: if someone has a different bank than this Portugal bank, they may be less likely to accept</li>
<li>Does the prospect have kids?</li>
<li>If so, what is the current education level or age of the kid(s)?</li>
<li>Is the bank agent who called male or female?</li>
<li>Is the prospect male or female?</li>
</ul>
<p>A (major) caveat is some of this info may be thought too personal to share.</p>

<h3>Rejecting the bank: what are the odds?</h3>
<p>For individuals with similar age, education, job, and marital status, what are the odds someone <em>with</em> a personal loan rejecting the bank’s offer compared to that of someone <em>without</em> a personal loan rejecting the bank’s offer? We’ll look at single college graduates in the age range 30-40 who work in administrative positions. These characteristics comprise one of the largest demographics targed by the bank.</p>

<p>From this we see, for instance, 226 people who rejected the bank (i.e. did not subscribe) had a personal loan. We can compute the odds ratio (the odds of rejecting) as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Odds of saying no, given that one has a personal loan: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{226}{23}\)</span></li>
<li>Odds of saying no, given that one doesn’t have a personal loan: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{976}{154}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore the odds of rejecting the bank’s offer if one has a personal loan is (226/23)/(976/154) = 1.55 times higher than the odds of rejecting the bank if one has no personal loan. This applies only to those with the prescribed characterisitcs above: between 30-40 years old, college grad, single, and working in admin.</p>
<p>Equivalently, the odds of someone with a personal loan rejecting the bank is 55% higher than the odds of someone without a personal loan rejecting the bank. This (again) applies only to those with the prescribed characterisitcs just mentioned.</p>
<p>If the banking agency chose its contacts based off of random sampling, then these inferences are applicable to those in the general public in the same demographic. Said differently, the scope of inference wouldn’t be restricted to just those in the current dataset. We’ll assume for simplicity that random sampling was used.</p>
<p>The upshot would then be this: the bank runs a higher risk of rejection if people in the aforementioned demographics have personal loans, which is pretty intuitive - people in debt are less likely to fork out money.</p>

<h3>Data Cleaning and Perform 1 hot encoding on categorical data</h3>
<p>Because the contact variable is binary, there is no need to encode it using OneHotEncoding. We can just convert it to an integer. The rest of the categorical variables will be OneHotEncoded.</p>
<p>We also get rid of the <code>duration</code> attribute since that cannot be known before the call is made. We get rid of <code>nr.employed</code> and <code>euribor3m</code> due to high correlation as mentioned earlier. We also get rid of <code>default</code> and <code>pdays</code> due to insufficient numbers of instances for different values of those classes. Then, we clean up the data by removing the columns that were OneHotEncoded, and the <code>unknown</code> values from the categorical data. The only exception will be for education, since in Part 1 we saw those with unknown education had the highest prevalence.</p>

<p>The accuracy hovers around 90% but the recall is abysmal! Again, this is a consequence of imbalanced classes.

<h3>Interpretation of the parameters with the highest weights on the final model:</h3>
<p>Features with the highest weights were interpreted by taking the exponential of the weight to determine the odds ratio. Interpretations of the parameters with the highest weights are as follows:</p>

<p>An increase in the Consumer price index (cons.price.idx) changes (increases) the odds of a customer to subscribe compared to one who won’t subscribe to the bank term deposit by a factor of 2.03 given all other features stay the same.</p>
<p>For customers who subscribed to a bank product previously due to a marketing campaign (poutcome_success), the odds for subscribing versus not subscribing to the bank term deposit are by a factor of 1.4 higher given all other features stay the same.</p>
<p>For customers who did not subscribe to a bank product due to a previous marketing campaign (poutcome_failure) the odds for subscribing versus not subscribing to the bank term deposit are lower by a factor of 0.8 given all other features stay the same.</p>
<p>For customers who were communicated to by cellular phone (isCellular), the odds for subscribing versus not subscribing to the bank term deposit are higher by a factor of 1.2 given that all other factors remain the same.</p>
<p>For customers who were last contacted in the month of March, the odds for subscribing compared to not subscribing to the bank term deposit are higher by a factor of 1.26, given that all other factors remain the same.</p>
<p>For customers who were last contacted in the month of May, the odds for subscribing compared to not subscribing to the bank term deposit are lower by a factor of 0.79, given that all other factors remain the same.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We need a model that can detect higher complexity and nonlinearities in the data, seeing logistic regression has proved fruitless (even with upsampling) in achieving good predictions. In Part 3 we build and tune a random forest model. As will be seen, it performs significantly better.</p>
