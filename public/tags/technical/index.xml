      <description>Prologue The Logistic function. Source: Wikipedia

It’s a bit disconcerting when textbooks or online sources provide derivations without fully spelling out the details. They’ll sometimes show steps 1, 2, and 5 without steps 3 and 4. And steps 1, 2, and 5 are sometimes better dealt with if the logic was fully fleshed out. Such is the case, in my opinion, when it comes to understanding maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for logistic regression gradient descent.</description>

      <description>Some Background There’s a lot of concepts we take for granted in applied statistics, like the CLT or properties of the mean and variance for standardized data. And that’s totally fine! Our job as applied analysts is to properly understand and implement statistical methods to derive value for whomever our stakeholders are.
That being said, it’s a good idea whenever possible to understand why things are the way they are.</description>
