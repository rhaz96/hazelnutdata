      <description>Prologue It’s a bit disconcerting when textbooks or online sources provide derivations without fully spelling out the details. They’ll sometimes show steps 1, 2, and 5 without steps 3 and 4. And steps 1, 2, and 5 are sometimes better dealt with if the logic was fully fleshed out. Such is the case, in my opinion, when it comes to understanding maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for logistic regression gradient descent.</description>

      <description>Capital BikeShare docking station  Introduction I love to bike, especially during the spring and summer. As a New York City resident the city affords miles of urban bike paths, my favorite being the seamless connection between Riverside and Hudson River parks. Of course thousands (if not millions) of others enjoy biking throughout the country, and if you don’t own a bike you can rent one through various bike programs, like NYC’s Citi Bike and Washington DC’s Capital BikeShare (CB henceforth).</description>
