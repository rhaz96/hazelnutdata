      <description>I’ve noticed some wierd quirks about Hugo Minimal, which is the theme used for this website. There’s no indication it supports by default rendering of LaTeX with MathJax. However, I have no problem rendering LaTex - see this post of mine for example.
What is problematic for me is including a plotly chart in a document that contains LaTeX. Plotly is nice if you want to include interactive plots in your documents.</description>
