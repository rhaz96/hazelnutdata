      <description>Last updated: Jun 22, 2020  Wait, what? I know, you most likely did a double take on the title. After all, we were all probably taught in algebra or geometry class that lines are linear functions. So presumably \(y = 2x+3\) is supposed to be a linear function…except that it’s not. In fact equations of the form \(y = mx+b\) are not considered linear functions except under special conditions, which will be explained a bit later.</description>
