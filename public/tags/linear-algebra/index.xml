      <description>Wait, what? We were all probably taught in algebra or geometry class that all lines are linear functions. So presumably \(y = 2x+3\) is supposed to be a linear function in algebra…except that it’s not. In fact equations of the form \(y = mx+b\) are not considered linear functions, except under special conditions which will be explained a bit later. All this raises the question: what are linear functions?</description>
