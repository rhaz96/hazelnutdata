 I recently came across an interesting probability question from Nate Rosidi, maintainer of the data science prep site Strata Scratch. This question was asked by FiveThirtyEight and goes like this:
 You start with a fair 6-sided die and roll it six times, recording the results of each roll. You then write these numbers on the six faces of another, unlabeled fair die.</description>

      <title>Lines are NOT linear functions !?!</title>

      <description>Last updated: Jun 22, 2020  Wait, what? I know, you most likely did a double take on the title. After all, we were all probably taught in algebra or geometry class that lines are linear functions. So presumably \(y = 2x+3\) is supposed to be a linear function…except that it’s not. In fact equations of the form \(y = mx+b\) are not considered linear functions except under special conditions, which will be explained a bit later.</description>

      <description>p.caption { font-size: 0.8em; }   The venerable House Price Competition on Kaggle  
In the graduate statistics class I’ve TA’ed, we explore a range of regression concepts, both theory and practice. This includes linear and polynomial regression, as well as transformations to align data to certain regression modeling assumptions. At the end of the course, students complete form groups to work on a project…the Kaggle housing prices competition on Ames, Iowa - perhaps the most well known and ongoing competition.</description>

      <title>Working around LaTeX and Plotly issue in Hugo Minimal</title>

      <description>I’ve noticed some wierd quirks about Hugo Minimal, which is the theme used for this website. There’s no indication it supports by default rendering of LaTeX with MathJax. However, I have no problem rendering LaTeX - see this post of mine for example.
What is problematic for me is including a plotly chart in a document that contains LaTeX. Plotly is nice if you want to include interactive plots in your documents.</description>

      <title>Proving the Properties of the Mean and Variance of Standardized Data</title>

      <description>Some Background There’s a lot of concepts we take for granted in applied statistics, like the CLT or properties of the mean and variance for standardized data. And that’s totally fine! Our job as applied analysts is to properly understand and implement statistical methods to derive value for whomever our stakeholders are.
That being said, it’s a good idea whenever possible to understand why things are the way they are.</description>

      <description>Capital BikeShare docking station  Introduction I love to bike, especially during the spring and summer. As a New York City resident the city affords miles of urban bike paths, my favorite being the seamless connection between Riverside and Hudson River parks. Of course thousands (if not millions) of others enjoy biking throughout the country, and if you don’t own a bike you can rent one through various bike programs, like NYC’s Citi Bike and Washington DC’s Capital BikeShare (CB henceforth).</description>

      <title>An Intuitive Explanation of p-values</title>

      <description>Striving for p-value enlightenment Trying to describe p-values is notoriously difficult, even for seasoned statistics professionals. This article from FiveThirtyEight has been at the back of my head for the longest time. The author Christie Aschwanden is basically fishing around for a basic, intuitive definition of a p-value. Her conclusion?
 “What I learned by asking all these very smart people to explain p-values is that I was on a fool’s errand.</description>

      <title>Clearing Some Confusion about the Central Limit Theorem</title>

      <description>p.caption { font-size: 0.8em; }     A Normal Distribution  What’s the Problem? For quite awhile I was wondering about a potential disconnect in the way the Central Limit Theorem (a.k.a CLT) is taught and how it’s applied. Usually in statistics textbooks and online tutorials the reasoning goes like this:
 Step 1: Collect a set of observations (say, 20) and calculate the mean of that one sample of data Step 2: Collect another set of 20 observations and calculate the mean of that second sample of data Step 3: Repeat this process many, many times (say 10,000 times) Step 4: You now have 10,000 sample means.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my blog! I&amp;rsquo;m Robert Hazell. My inspiration for this comes from my work I began in January 2020 as a teaching assistant to a graduate-level applied statistics course at SMU, where I&amp;rsquo;m currently completing my Masters degree in data science (expected graduation: August 2020). I received my undergrad degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
I started this blog in March 2020 to capture and solidify my statistics and data science musings that I hope illuminates concepts in those fields for both you and me.</description>
