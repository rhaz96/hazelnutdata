      <description>Striving for p-value enlightenment Trying to describe p-values is notoriously difficult, even for seasoned statistics professionals. This article from FiveThirtyEight has been at the back of my head for the longest time. The author Christie Aschwanden is basically fishing around for a basic, intuitive definition of a p-value. Her conclusion?
 “What I learned by asking all these very smart people to explain p-values is that I was on a fool’s errand.</description>

      <description>p.caption { font-size: 0.8em; }     A Normal Distribution  What’s the Problem? For quite awhile I was wondering about a potential disconnect in the way the Central Limit Theorem (a.k.a CLT) is taught and how it’s applied. Usually in statistics textbooks and online tutorials the reasoning goes like this:
 Step 1: Collect a set of observations (say, 20) and calculate the mean of that one sample of data Step 2: Collect another set of 20 observations and calculate the mean of that second sample of data Step 3: Repeat this process many, many times (say 10,000 times) Step 4: You now have 10,000 sample means.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my blog! My inspiration for this comes from my work as a teaching assistant to a graduate-level applied statistics course at SMU, where I&amp;rsquo;m currently completing my Masters degree in data science.
This blog is designed to capture my statistics and data science musings that I hope illuminates concepts in those fields.
In my spare time I love reading philosophy, biking throughout New York City, and long walks.</description>
