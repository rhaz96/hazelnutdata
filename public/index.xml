      <title>Proving the Properties of the Mean and Variance of Standardized Data</title>

      <description>Some Background There’s a lot of concepts we take for granted in applied statistics, like the CLT or properties of the mean and variance for standardized data. And that’s totally fine! Our job as applied analysts is to properly understand and implement statistical methods to derive value for whomever our stakeholders are.
That being said, it’s a good idea whenever possible to understand why things are the way they are.</description>

      <title>Testing LaTeX with Plotly in Hugo Minimal</title>

      <description>I’ve noticed some wierd quirks about Hugo Minimal, which is the theme used for this website. There’s no indication it supports by default rendering of LaTeX with MathJax. However, I have no problem rendering LaTex - see this post of mine for example.
What is problematic for me is including a plotly chart in a document that contains LaTeX. Plotly is nice if you want to include interactive plots in your documents.</description>

      <description>Capital BikeShare docking station  Introduction I love to bike, especially during the spring and summer. As a New York City resident the city affords miles of urban bike paths, my favorite being the seamless connection between Riverside and Hudson River parks. Of course thousands (if not millions) of others enjoy biking throughout the country, and if you don’t own a bike you can rent one through various bike programs, like NYC’s Citi Bike and Washington DC’s Capital BikeShare (CB henceforth).</description>

      <title>An Intuitive Explanation of p-values</title>

      <description>Striving for p-value enlightenment Trying to describe p-values is notoriously difficult, even for seasoned statistics professionals. This article from FiveThirtyEight has been at the back of my head for the longest time. The author Christie Aschwanden is basically fishing around for a basic, intuitive definition of a p-value. Her conclusion?
 “What I learned by asking all these very smart people to explain p-values is that I was on a fool’s errand.</description>

      <title>Clearing Some Confusion about the Central Limit Theorem</title>

      <description>p.caption { font-size: 0.8em; }     A Normal Distribution  What’s the Problem? For quite awhile I was wondering about a potential disconnect in the way the Central Limit Theorem (a.k.a CLT) is taught and how it’s applied. Usually in statistics textbooks and online tutorials the reasoning goes like this:
 Step 1: Collect a set of observations (say, 20) and calculate the mean of that one sample of data Step 2: Collect another set of 20 observations and calculate the mean of that second sample of data Step 3: Repeat this process many, many times (say 10,000 times) Step 4: You now have 10,000 sample means.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my blog! I&amp;rsquo;m Robert Hazell. My inspiration for this comes from my work as a teaching assistant to a graduate-level applied statistics course at SMU, where I&amp;rsquo;m currently completing my Masters degree in data science.
This blog is designed to capture my statistics and data science musings that I hope illuminates concepts in those fields.
In my spare time I love reading philosophy, biking throughout New York City, and long walks.</description>
